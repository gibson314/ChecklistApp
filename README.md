# ChecklistApp
Our app serves as a way for users to collaborate with their roommates for the tasks of moving into an apartment, grocery shopping, chore assignments, receipt storage and money management, and shopping for communal items. We are targeting students living in a college apartment, students living in greek housing, and couples living together in an apartment or adults living in post-grad apartments. College students in both greek housing and apartments move frequently, struggle with having roommates for the first time, and live with a multitude of different people. Couples, however, are much more collaborative, have joined finances, move less frequently, and have a higher need for the grocery and chore functionality. Our app will be relevant to people living with other roommates both in college and afterwards. After conducting our research, we have determined that there is a need for an app like ours to increase communication between roommates, streamline the move-in process, and facilitate chores and grocery shopping within a communal space.
